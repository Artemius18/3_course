The Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers. The Internet enables computers to send one another small packets of digital data. For that to work, they use a protocol called TCP/IP and every computer is given an address or IP number.
To use the Internet, you need the modem. The modem converts the digital signals stored in the computer into analogue signals. There are two basic types of modem: external with a cable that is connected to the computer in the USB port, and internal, an expansion card inside the computer.
At first most computers used a dial-up telephone connection. Now a broadband connection and a high data transmission connection.
The Internet consists of multiple data systems. The World Wide Web, a collection of files or pages containing links to other documents on the Net.
Most Internet services are now integrated on the Web. For example, e-mail, chat, instant messaging and video conference.
In conclusion, Iâ€™d like to say that IT helps communicate with distant relatives, and many processes are automated: for example, we can place an online order. On the other hand, communication in person disappears, people become lazier and passive.
